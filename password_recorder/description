In this Project, I created a password recorder where you can recored username and password. The password is
recorded in encrypted in from which you can check in the passowrd_list file
Key_key file is created, once you uncomment the commented code.
After you have recorded the password, you can view it by pressing view. The passowrd can be viewed in the decrypted form. 

Steps to run:

Once you have downloaded the code
delete the password_list and key_key file
uncomment the commented code
and run the program
after running, key_key file will be created
Again, comment the code, else you will face the problem
And run the code, you will be asked for master code, if have not set any credential for it. So press any key
And then type 'add' and enter 'username' and 'password'
you can see the recorded data in encrypted form.

To view the recorded data, type 'view' and you can see the username and password in decrypted form.

Thank you Hope you understand
